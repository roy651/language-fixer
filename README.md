# Language Fixer

A flexible macOS utility that retroactively fixes text typed in the wrong keyboard layout. Supports multiple language pairs with configurable hotkeys.

## Features

- **Multiple Language Support**: Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, or create your own
- **Configurable Hotkeys**: Each language pair can have its own hotkey
- **Toggle-Back**: Press hotkey again to revert the conversion
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects the source language
- **Seamless Integration**: Runs quietly in the background
- **Configurable Buffer**: Adjust how long typed text is remembered
- **RTL Support**: Properly handles right-to-left text

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on macOS 10.14+)
- Python 3.12+

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

**One-command installation:**

```bash
pipx install language-fixer
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install language-fixer
```

**Setup as background service:**
```bash
language-fixer-install-service
```

**Grant accessibility permissions:**
- Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
- Add Terminal (or your terminal app) to the list of allowed apps
- This is required for the keyboard listener to work

### Option 2: Install from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-fixer.git
   cd language-fixer
   ```

2. **Install with uv**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Grant accessibility permissions** (same as above)

4. **Install as service** (optional):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh
   ```

## Quick Start

### Default Mode (Hebrew-English)

```bash
uv run python -m language_fixer
```

Press `Cmd+Shift+H` to convert between Hebrew and English.

### With Configuration

1. **Copy the example config**:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. **Edit config.yaml** to enable/disable language pairs and customize hotkeys

3. **Run**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m language_fixer
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root to customize behavior:

```yaml
# Buffer timeout in seconds
buffer_timeout: 10.0

# Language pairs
language_pairs:
  - name: "Hebrew-English"
    mapping_file: "mappings/hebrew-english.json"
    hotkey: "cmd+shift+h"
    enabled: true

  - name: "Arabic-English"
    mapping_file: "mappings/arabic-english.json"
    hotkey: "cmd+shift+a"
    enabled: true

  - name: "Russian-English"
    mapping_file: "mappings/russian-english.json"
    hotkey: "cmd+shift+r"
    enabled: true
```

### Built-in Language Mappings

- **Hebrew-English**: `mappings/hebrew-english.json`
- **Arabic-English**: `mappings/arabic-english.json`
- **Russian-English**: `mappings/russian-english.json`

## Creating Custom Language Mappings

Use the built-in mapping generator:

```bash
uv run language-fixer-generate-mapping
```

The tool will:
1. Ask for language pair details
2. Guide you through mapping each key
3. Save the mapping file in the `mappings/` directory
4. Show you how to add it to your config

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

1. Type text in wrong language: `akuo` (meant to type שלום)
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+H`
3. Text converts to: `שלום`

### Toggle Back

1. Type: `hello` → Press `Cmd+Shift+H` → Converts to: `יקךךם`
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+H` again (immediately) → Reverts to: `hello`

### Multiple Languages

With config enabled for multiple languages:
- `Cmd+Shift+H` for Hebrew-English
- `Cmd+Shift+A` for Arabic-English
- `Cmd+Shift+R` for Russian-English

## Running as Background Service

To have Language Fixer start automatically when you log in, use the provided management scripts:

### Install as Service
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Management Commands
```bash
# Check if running
./scripts/is_running.sh

# View logs
./scripts/view_logs.sh
./scripts/view_logs.sh -f    # Follow logs in real-time

# Restart service
./scripts/restart.sh

# Uninstall service
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

### Manual Service Control
```bash
# Stop the service
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.languagefixer.plist

# Start the service
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.languagefixer.plist
```

## How It Works

Language Fixer monitors your keyboard input and maintains a buffer of recently typed characters. When you press a hotkey:

1. Detects the source language of the buffered text
2. Maps each character to its equivalent on the target keyboard layout
3. Deletes the original text
4. Pastes the converted text

The conversion is based on physical keyboard positions, so each key maps to its equivalent character in the other language.

## Uninstallation

1. **Stop and remove the LaunchAgent** (if installed):
   ```bash
   launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.languagefixer.plist
   rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.languagefixer.plist
   ```

2. **Remove the project**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rm -rf language-fixer
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**The hotkey doesn't work:**
- Make sure you've granted Accessibility permissions to your terminal app
- Try restarting the application
- Check that your hotkey doesn't conflict with other apps

**Text isn't converting correctly:**
- The buffer has a timeout (default 10 seconds) - press the hotkey within this window
- The converter works on buffered text only - if you've pressed Enter, Tab, or arrow keys, the buffer is cleared

**Service won't start:**
- Check the error logs: `cat /tmp/languagefixer.err`
- Make sure uv is installed and in your PATH
- Verify the paths in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.languagefixer.plist` are correct

**Config file errors:**
- Make sure PyYAML is installed: `uv sync`
- Check your config.yaml syntax is valid YAML
- Verify mapping file paths are correct and files exist

**Custom mapping not working:**
- Ensure the mapping file is valid JSON
- Check that the mapping file path in config.yaml is correct
- Make sure the language pair is enabled in config
